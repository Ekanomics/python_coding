1.
# list = [False, True, "2", 3, 4, 5]
# b = 0 in list
# print(b)



2.
# my_tuple[1] = my_tuple[1] + my_tuple[0]
#  Tuples are immutable
# That means, that once a tuple is created, it's elements cannot be changed


3.
# x = [0, 1, 2]    # [0, 1, 2]
# x.insert(0, 1)   # [1, 0, 1, 2] adds 1 as index 0
# del x[1]         # deletes index 1, so it becomes [1, 1, 2]
# print(sum(x))    # 4


4.
# list1 = [1, 3]
# list2 = list1
# list1[0] = 4
# print(list2)

# Answer: [4, 3]
